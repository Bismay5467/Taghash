## 🧑‍💻Developmemt

To improve our development process, we've set up tooling and systems. Taghash uses a client server architecture.

### ⚒️Tooling

📌 VS Code as the preferred code editor.

📌 NPM to manage pacakges and dependencies

📌 Prettier for code formatting.

📌 MySQl server running on localhost at PORT 3306

## 💻 Setup the Project

The following steps will get you up and running to contribute to Taghash:

1. Fork the repo (click the <kbd>Fork</kbd> button at the top right of
   [this page](https://github.com/Bismay5467/Taghash.git))

2. Clone your fork locally

```sh
git clone https://github.com/<your github username>/Taghash.git
```

3. Setup all the dependencies and packages by running `npm ci`.

```sh
cd server && npm ci
cd client && npm ci
```

Note : Don't forget to change the env variables meant for mysql database. Change them based on the configuration of the mysql server in your local device.

Now you are good to go!! Client would be running on PORT 5173 and Server would be running on PORT 5000! 🚀✨
